= Add, Delete, Rename =
* `git add <filename>`
* `git rm <filename>`
* `git mv <old filename> <new filename>`

= Undo, Redo =
* Check changes since last commit → `git status`
* Check commit log → `git log`
* The first few characters of the commit hash are enough to specify the commit.

*Restore changes in a file since last commit*
* `git restore <file name>`

*Restore to a earlier commit permanently*
* `git reset --hard <commit hash>`

*Restore to a earlier commit temporarily*
* Restore the whole repo → `git checkout <commit hash>`
* Restore specific file → `git checkout <commit hash> file1 file2`
* Other ways to checkout to previous commit
    - Via number → `git checkout master~5` → 5th last saved commit
    - Via starting of commit message → `git checkout :/"My First Com"`
* It is a detached HEAD state. Here we can do experimental changes.
* Now we have 2 options
    - Save the experimental changes to a new branch → `git switch c <new branch name>`
    - Switch back to actual position removing experimental changes → `git switch -` or `git checkout <existing branch name>`

*Revert back to previous commit*
* In this case repo reverts (undoes) a previous commit and set it as new commit. Hence previous commit history is retained, unlike `git reset`
* First check all the present commits are done (`git commit -a`) and then `git revert <commit hash>`.

= Regain deleted files =
*Preserving changes of other files*
* `git checkout <When file was present commit hash> file1 file2`

*Adding patch for diff between deletion commit and its previous commit*
* `git diff <Deletion commit hash> <Previous of the deletion commit hash> | git apply`
* Note, all other changes within the 2 commits will also be added.

*Revert back the deletion commit*
* `git revert <Deletion commit hash>`
* Note, all other changes happened during the deletion commit will also be reverted.


= What has been changed =
*Change since last commit*
* Change `git diff`

*Change since some time*
* Since 4 hours → `git diff "@{4 hours}`
* Since yesterday → `git diff "@{yesterday}"`
* Since 2 weeks → `git whatchanged --since="2 weeks ago"`
* Since an specific commit and 2nd last commit → `git diff <specific commit hash> master~2`

= Git Merge Conflict =
* Add, Commit and Try to push. If there is conflict push won't happen.
* Then pull the repo first. Git will try to merge the changes automatically.
* If there is a conflict, git will tell `CONFLICT: ...`
* So open those file and manually merge.
* Then git add and commit.
* Try to git push again.

= Ignore Files =
* To ignore for all users: Mention the file in `$GIT_DIR/.gitignore`
* To ignore for a specific user: Mention the file in `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude`
* In case the file was already tracked by git, but now you want to ignore → `git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>`
