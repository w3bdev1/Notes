* `import pandas as pd`
* Read csv and save as dataframe (rows and columns) → `df = pd.read_csv('<path to csv>')`
* Set max columns to show → `pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 10)`
* Show first 10 lines from the dataframe → `df.head(10)`
* Show last 10 lines from the dataframe → `df.tail(10)`

= DataFrames =
* It represents a 2D data having rows and columns.
* It is actually based on a dictionary. Columns are the keys. Values under a column is a list value of that particular key.
* But the dataframe has more functionality than a regular python dictionary.

*Create a DataFrame*
* Creating such dictionary
{{{
    people = {
        "first": ["John", "Jane"],
        "last": ["Green", "Doe"]
    }
}}}
* Now we can create a dataframe based on this dictionary → `df = pd.DataFrame(people)`
* Now `df` looks like this
{{{
     	first 	last
    0 	John 	Green
    1 	Jane 	Doe
}}}

*Access values from a column*
